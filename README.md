# [HepLib](https://heplib.github.io/web/)

**HepLib** is a C++ library for computations in _High Energy Physics_ with the help of **GiNaC** language which is a C++ library used to perform symbolic computations.

**HepLib** combines several well-known packages to get high efficiency, including

* **Fermat** to perform multivariate polynomial simplification, matrix operators, ...
* **FORM** to perform _Dirac_ and _Color_ matrix related computations, polynomial factorization, ...
* **Qgraf** to generate the Feynman aptitudes/diagrams.
* **FIRE** or **KIRA** for the _IBP_ reduction.

Another core feature of **HepLib** is the numerical evaluation of _Master Integrals_ using _Sector Decomposition_ with a customizable numerical integrator including the arbitrary precision supported by **MPFR**.
